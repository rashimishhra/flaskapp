# Attempt How To 

## Set up the basic code on VS following instructions to develop flask app - https://github.com/jsoma/flask-tutorial

## CSV File

### The csv file needed permission to be accessed using chmod command on the terminal below in VS code- chmod 605

## HTML page display

### The first issue encountered was while running the local host, the data from the csv file did not display on the page. The page only showed an empty table

### The issue was also about naming and matching the files in the html page file in VS code and the excel file - the columns names have to be exact same

### In addition to this, space within the curly brackets in the loan and cla html files while coding variable need to be removed for then to be displayed. Eg: <td>{{loan['BU_ID']}}</td>

## Routes

### Setting up routes and rendering them through templates - https://github.com/jsoma/flask-tutorial

### Issue with “view details” column on route “cla” - did not take me to the loan page. Issue with the app route coded as integer instead of string 

### Loan html page styled on loan html file - same issue in display as on cla page due to non-matching of columns and space within the curly brackets
